# GitOps-Pipeline-with-Argo-CD-in-Kubernetes

## Overview
we will dockerize a simple web application, deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using Argo CD, and manage its release process with Argo Rollouts. This is divided into four main tasks: 
1) setup and configuration.
2) creating the GitOps pipeline.
3) implementing a canary release.
4) Clean up & documentation.
