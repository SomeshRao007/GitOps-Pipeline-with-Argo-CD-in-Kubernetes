# GitOps-Pipeline-with-Argo-CD-in-Kubernetes

## Overview
we will dockerize a simple web application, deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using Argo CD, and manage its release process with Argo Rollouts. This is divided into four main tasks: 
1) setup and configuration.
2) creating the GitOps pipeline.
3) implementing a canary release.
4) Clean up & documentation.

## Task 1: Setup and Configuration

Firstly, Create a Github repository and host your source code in the same repository.
Now log into your Linux system and install minikube, check for the installation script in my repositry https://github.com/SomeshRao007/Autoscalling_minikube_helm.git for installation script one and two, clone it then run:

```
bash installation_script.sh
```
or just download it from offical document. 

to check version if you dont have download it

```
minikube version
```
you can specify your desired driver using the --driver flag and add Docker as your driver:

```
minikube start --driver=docker
```
Use the following command to check your Kubernetes cluster status

```
minikube status
```
If output is this, then good to go. Otherwise check your installation.
```
somesh@somesh-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ minikube status 
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```
I wanted to check is there any pods running for that

```
kubectl get pods -A

tag -A means in all namespaces
```

~~~
NAMESPACE     NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE

kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube                    1/1     Running   0             79s
kube-system   storage-provisioner                        1/1     Running   1 (36s ago)   76s
~~~

Secondly, we have Install Argo CD on Your Kubernetes Cluster
We can follow the official Argo CD documentation to install and set up Argo CD. But I will list all the command for you:

To Install: 
~~~
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
~~~

To confirm the installation check for the running pods :

~~~
kubectl get pods -A
~~~
~~~
NAMESPACE     NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
argocd        argocd-application-controller-0                     1/1     Running   0              51s
argocd        argocd-applicationset-controller-75b78554fd-55r6b   1/1     Running   0              52s
argocd        argocd-dex-server-869fff9967-k5mlz                  1/1     Running   0              52s
argocd        argocd-notifications-controller-5b8dbb7c86-rldkm    1/1     Running   0              52s
argocd        argocd-redis-66d9777b78-smc4h                       1/1     Running   0              52s
argocd        argocd-repo-server-7b8d97c767-96rzh                 1/1     Running   0              52s
argocd        argocd-server-5c797497fb-xklvq                      1/1     Running   0              51s

If you are running a VMware Virtual machine then please wait it will take time as per allocated resources.
If you see all these pods up and running then you are good to go. 

Lets check services:
for default namespace
~~~
kubectl get svc 
~~~

for a specific namespace use -n tag:

~~~
kubectl get svc -n argocd
~~~

~~~
NAME                                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
argocd-applicationset-controller          ClusterIP   10.97.219.135   <none>        7000/TCP,8080/TCP            2m7s
argocd-dex-server                         ClusterIP   10.106.76.191   <none>        5556/TCP,5557/TCP,5558/TCP   2m7s
argocd-metrics                            ClusterIP   10.111.161.2    <none>        8082/TCP                     2m7s
argocd-notifications-controller-metrics   ClusterIP   10.103.253.61   <none>        9001/TCP                     2m7s
argocd-redis                              ClusterIP   10.111.1.230    <none>        6379/TCP                     2m7s
argocd-repo-server                        ClusterIP   10.111.241.53   <none>        8081/TCP,8084/TCP            2m7s
argocd-server                             ClusterIP   10.100.12.23    <none>        80/TCP,443/TCP               2m7s
argocd-server-metrics                     ClusterIP   10.97.68.20     <none>        8083/TCP                     2m7s
~~~

Editing __argocd-server__ service from cluster ip to nodeport so can we can access it. Simply check for _type_ at the bottom of the document, which will be opened after running this command: 

~~~
kubectl edit svc argocd-server -n argocd

service/argocd-server edited
~~~

now, after editing that we need to create a http and https tunnel for us to use.

~~~
minikube service argocd-server -n argocd
~~~

you will get a IP address something like 192.27..... its a private ip you can just copy paste that in your browser.

Or as an alternative you can do port forwarding 

```
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

To Fetch username and password for Admin (as we areðŸ˜…) follow the steps below:
all confidentails data is stored in secret servers

~~~
kubectl get secret -n argocd
~~~
~~~
NAME                          TYPE     DATA   AGE
argocd-initial-admin-secret   Opaque   1      30m
argocd-notifications-secret   Opaque   0      102m
argocd-secret                 Opaque   5      102m
~~~

we will open the file as if we are going to edit it but we will copy the password, you can use describe command too but it wont work for our purpose since, it will hide all the passwords. 

The password you copied is an encrypted password we will decrypt it with:

~~~
echo <password> | base64 --decode #to decode the password
~~~

Sign up into argocd by entering ipaddress given by minikube tunnel & you willsee a login page 
__vollaaa!!__

Lastly, installation of Argo Rollouts
Again, we install the Argo Rollouts controller in your Kubernetes cluster, by following the official guide. but i will share the commands i used. 

~~~
kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts
kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
~~~
this will work.

And for kubectl plugins:
basically we are downloading that scrip file __curl__, then making it executable file with __chmod +x__ and we are running that file with __./__ and moving the output to /usr/local/bin/kubectl-argo-rollouts location.

~~~
curl -LO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64
sudo mv ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubectl-argo-rollouts
~~~

installation is complete. 

## Task 2: Creating the GitOps Pipeline
## Dockerize the Application
we will build a Docker image for our web application and push it to a _**public container registry**_ of your choice.


### Creating Docker Image 

For docker image, i am using my porfolio website so starting with cloning my git repo u can use you can use your own website: 

~~~
git clone https://github.com/SomeshRao007/SomeshRao007.github.io.git

cd SomeshRao007.github.io.git
~~~

how to create a image for my website? basically we need to install all dependencies if node.js or anyother stack based then refer docker hub for that image and take a glance at commands. For me it was httpd, so i search at docker hub for httpd and found how to write docker commands follow: https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd#:~:text=Create%20a%20Dockerfile%20in%20your%20project

Lets create a Dockerfile

~~~
vi Dockerfile 
~~~

write this in that file

~~~
FROM httpd:2.4
COPY ./ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
~~~

FROM command takes the base image of http2.4 and then with COPY command, we are copying everthing in our local directory to server location. 
to save esc wq

__Next step building a image__ 

```
docker build -t <your image name> <your docker file location use . if you are in the same dir>
```

To check image

~~~
docker images
~~~

> Docker internally runs on a client/server architecture. In particular, when you run docker build, it creates a tar file of the directory you specify, sends that tar file across a socket to the Docker daemon, and unpacks it there. (True even on a totally local system.)

~~~
docker run -itd -port 3000:80 --name website myweb
~~~

We are running docker in background __-itd tag__ on port 3000 (__container port : host port__) and name of the container website from the image _myweb_.

to check go to 127.0.0.1/3000 (or type localhost:3000)

__vollaa!!__


Now, lets push this into our registry, I am using AWS ECR as i am comfortable with AWS services SignIn into the AWS console and naviagte to ECR (Elastic contriner registry) in search box. I am creating a a public registry and if you want enhanced security enable encryption but, i am leaving it disabled.

if you go to the registry and click on push commands it will give you commands follow that: 

To retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.

```
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/n8y8c3i1
```

After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

~~~~
docker tag argocdtest:latest public.ecr.aws/n8y8c3i1/argocdtest:latest
~~~~

Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository

~~~
docker push public.ecr.aws/n8y8c3i1/argocdtest:latest
~~~

After a sucessfull push u will see this: 

`
The push refers to repository [public.ecr.aws/n8y8c3i1/argocdtest]
